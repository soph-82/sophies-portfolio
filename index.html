									<h2><a href="#">KiaKiA Mart Sales Performance</a></h2>
									<p>This project was designed to provide a comprehensive, visually intuitive view of key sales and business performance metrics across multiple years (2021–2024). My primary goal was to create an end-to-end analytical tool that empowers business owners, managers, and analysts to make informed decisions using real-time insights..</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Dreamy Bites ||<br />
										Customer and Product Analysis using Power BI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Dreamy Bites.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The objective of the Dreamy Bites Product & Customer Analysis Dashboard was to transform raw sales, expense, and customer data from September 2019 to December 2020 into a clear and actionable business intelligence report. The dashboard was designed to help the business understand product profitability, customer contribution, sales trends, and operational performance while offering a user-friendly interface for filtering and decision-making. Key metrics such as total profit ($2.72M), total expense ($1.97M), total quantity sold (1M units), and profit margin (58%) were highlighted to give management a complete view of business health across both products and customers.

This project successfully delivered a two-page interactive Power BI report that identifies top-performing products (e.g., Chocolate Chip) and high-value customers (e.g., ACME Bites), while also exposing underperforming segments and seasonal peaks. Using Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and DAX, I built profit–expense comparisons, sales trend analysis, order distribution views, and target gauges that support fast strategic decision-making. Based on the insights, I recommend scaling production for consistently high-demand products, optimizing costs for items with lower margins, strengthening relationships with top customers, and launching targeted promotions for low-performing customer accounts or product lines.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Tri-fleet Industry||<br />
										Sales Analysis using Power BI service
								</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/trifleet.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In this project for Tri-Fleet Industries, the objective was to transform complex, multi-dimensional sales data into secure, role-based insights that stakeholders could easily explore and present. The organization needed visibility into overall sales performance against targets while also enabling managers to analyze product, regional, and territory-level performance without exposing data outside their scope. Static reporting limited flexibility during reviews and made it difficult to support different audiences from a single analytics solution.

To address this, I designed and deployed an interactive Power BI dashboard using Power BI Service, incorporating scorecards, product-level analysis, and time-based trend insights. Row-Level Security (RLS) was implemented to ensure managers accessed only their respective performance views, while executives received a consolidated, high-level perspective.
 The solution centralized visibility into $10M+ in sales and 99K+ units sold, reduced reporting effort by approximately 60% through automation and self-service analytics, and enabled insight-driven recommendations around seasonality, product performance, and operational focus

										<h2><a href="#">Novamed Solutions ||<br />
										Sales Performance Analysis Report</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/NOVAMEDS PIC.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Using Power BI, I developed an interactive sales performance dashboard for Novamed Solutions to help the company gain clearer visibility into its revenue, profitability, product performance, and customer behaviour. The business previously struggled with scattered data, limited insight into profit-driving products, and no structured way to analyse customer or regional trends. By cleaning and modelling the data, creating key DAX measures, and designing a multi-page dashboard, I provided leadership with a comprehensive view of monthly trends, top and bottom products, regional performance, and customer profitability.

The analysis revealed high-performing drugs and customers, highlighted underperforming products, and uncovered strong revenue contributions from specific regions such as Canada and Australia. Based on these insights, I recommended prioritising top-selling products, re-evaluating loss-driving items, strengthening relationships with high-value customers, and exploring targeted marketing based on demographic trends. The final dashboard enabled Novamed Solutions to reduce reporting time, improve decision-making, and adopt a more data-driven strategy for sales and customer management.

										<h2><a href="#">Deskify Office supply Analysis using Excel<br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Deskify Office Supply.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Deskify Office Supply Report Dashboard is a multi-page Power BI analytics solution designed to provide deep insights into customer behavior, product profitability, and operational performance from 2009 to 2012. The objective of the project was to transform raw retail data into an intuitive, interactive reporting tool that enables stakeholders to monitor key metrics such as total revenue, profit, orders, customer count, profit margin, and regional performance. Through detailed visuals including treemaps, bar charts, trend lines, donut charts, and geographic maps the dashboard reveals top performing states, product categories, sub categories, customer segments, and individual customers. It also highlights operational insights such as ship mode performance and month by month profit trends to support planning and strategic decision-making.

Using Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and DAX. I handled data cleaning, modeling, KPI creation, and visualization design to build a smooth, user-friendly reporting experience. This project showcases my ability to deliver end to end business intelligence solutions from preparing the data and building accurate DAX measures to designing modern, visually compelling dashboards. The final report helps Deskify identify profit drivers, understand customer value, optimize product strategy, and improve overall decision-making through clear and actionable insights.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Clarity Clear Suicide<br />
										 Analysis using Power BI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/MENTAL HEALTH.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This Power BI project, Clarity Clear Suicide Analytics, was developed to analyze global suicide trends across 101 countries, focusing on key demographic dimensions such as age group, gender, and generational cohorts. Using Power Query for data transformation and interactive visuals, the dashboard highlights critical insights including the high prevalence of suicides among males, the significantly affected 35–54 and 55–74 age groups, and the generational impact—where Boomers, the Silent Generation, and Gen X record the highest numbers. Advanced Power BI features such as Key Influencers and AI-driven segmentation were used to uncover hidden patterns, helping to identify conditions under which suicide rates are more or less likely to occur.

Based on the findings, several recommendations were derived to guide targeted mental-health interventions. These include prioritizing support for middle-aged and older adults, expanding men-focused mental-health awareness, and strengthening national reporting systems for more reliable data. Interventions such as workplace mental-health programs, elderly support networks, and stigma-reduction initiatives are essential to addressing the identified risk groups. Overall, the project demonstrates the power of data analytics in supporting informed decisions on a sensitive global issue and showcases strong analytical, visualization, and insight-generation skills using Power BI.

										<h2><a href="#">aurora Threads Boutique Performance Analysis Using Power BI<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/aurora T.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Aurora Trends Boutique, a growing fashion retailer with three store locations, struggled with scattered sales data, unclear product performance, and limited visibility into customer purchasing behavior. Management had no clear way to identify best-selling products, track daily revenue patterns, or understand which payment methods and gender segments were driving sales. They needed a centralized and intuitive analytics solution to make smarter inventory, marketing, and customer-engagement decisions.

To address this, I cleaned and modeled their data using Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and DAX, then built an interactive dashboard showing revenue by category, product, gender, store, and payment type. The dashboard revealed key insights, such as Accessories being the top revenue generator (148K), Unisex items driving the highest sales share, and cash and online payments dominating customer transactions. Based on these findings, I recommended increasing stock for high-performing accessory items, improving marketing for weaker categories, expanding unisex product offerings, encouraging digital payments, and creating loyalty incentives for top customers.

										<h2><a href="#">10alytics Sale Performance Analysis Using Excel<br />

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/10Alytics Sales Performance Dashboard.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>10Alytics, a growing retail and distribution business, needed clarity on its overall sales performance across regions, customer demographics, and product categories. The company struggled with scattered data and lacked a unified view of key metrics such as profit trends, top-performing locations, and customer profitability. To address this, I transformed their raw dataset using Excel, Power Query, Power BI, and DAX, building an interactive dashboard that visualizes total transactions, quantity sold, cost, revenue, and profit/loss. The dashboard also highlights profit trends over time, gender contribution, customer age group performance, and regional profitability.

The report revealed valuable insights, including Lagos and Abuja as the most profitable regions, Adults as the highest-contributing customer group, and Phones and Accessories as top revenue generators. Based on these findings, I recommended that 10Alytics expand investment in high-performing regions and product categories, refine marketing strategies toward profitable age groups, and re-evaluate pricing or cost structures in weaker categories and regions. This dashboard now serves as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making and business growth..</p>

										<h2><a href="#">NEXTGEM EMPLOYEE SUCCESS ANALYSIS  <br />
										using SQL</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/next gem.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Next Gen Corp is a rapidly expanding tech and marketing company focused on delivering digital innovation solutions across multiple departments, including Engineering, HR, Sales, and Marketing. As the organization grew, leadership struggled to track workforce performance, salary distribution, hiring trends, and turnover rates effectively. Using SQL to clean, transform, and analyze employee data, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that centralizes all major HR insights. The solution highlights key metrics such as a $5M total salary expense, $81K average salary, 4.14 average performance score, and detailed department comparisons. It also uncovers hiring patterns, job-title salary structures, and turnover distribution—showing that 57% of exits occurred in 2024, a critical insight for HR strategy.

The dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of employee success, enabling leadership to identify high-performing departments like Engineering and Sales while pinpointing areas needing support, such as HR and departments with lower performance scores. Based on these insights, I recommend conducting deeper analysis into the causes of 2024 turnover, implementing retention initiatives for departments with lower satisfaction, and aligning recruitment efforts with workforce demand patterns identified through SQL-based hiring analysis. Additionally, optimizing salary structures across job titles can improve fairness and reduce internal discrepancies. Together, these actions will strengthen employee engagement, improve performance, and support long-term organizational growth.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PURESIP SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS USING POWER BI <br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PURESIP PIC.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Next Gen Corp is a mid-sized technology and marketing firm focused on innovation, digital transformation, and customer-centric solutions. As the company expanded its workforce across Engineering, Marketing, Sales, and HR, leadership struggled to monitor salary expenses, employee performance trends, department turnover, and hiring activity. To provide clarity and improve decision-making, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that centralizes employee success metrics and highlights key workforce insights.

The dashboard reveals that Next Gen Corp maintains an annual salary expense of $5M, with an average departmental salary of $81K and an average performance score of 4.14 across all teams. Engineering and Sales lead in performance, while Marketing holds the highest total performance contribution (570). The company recorded 26 employees earning above $80K, and hiring trends show consistent recruitment across departments. Turnover analysis shows that 2024 carries 57% of total exits, a critical insight for HR planning. Overall, the dashboard achieves full visibility into employee performance, salary distribution, turnover patterns, departmental comparisons, and job-title salary benchmarks—empowering leadership with data-driven workforce insights.

To strengthen organizational success, I recommend deeper root-cause analysis behind higher turnover in 2024, enhanced retention programs for HR and lower-performing teams, and salary optimization based on job roles to reduce discrepancies. Additionally, the company could leverage hiring pattern insights to align recruitment with periods of strong business demand. Implementing these recommendations will help Next Gen Corp enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and optimize workforce performance for long-term growth.</p>
